  <h1>Bosses:</h1>
  <h3>You can begin to battle bosses when you meet the level requirements necessary for fighting a particular boss. <br></br>Bosses require 3 battle stock. Boss fights occur over several phases (similar to battles) where you have a chance of phase victory. You and the boss deal damage to one another at the end of the phase based on many conditions, primarily your higher stat between POW and WIS. <br></br>Your damage dealt is significantly reduced when you lose the phase. Damage dealt and damage received can also be heavily dependent on what actives you or the boss have. Beware of special boss actives! When either the HP of yourself or the boss drops to 0, the boss fight ends. <br></br>If you reached 0 HP first (or at the same time as the boss), you lose and don't receive any rewards. If you defeat the boss first, you have a chance at receiving loot, always receiving the first time drop if it's the first time you beat the boss (or if you sold/lost the first time drop) and possibly more based on your luck. <br></br>Bosses have an array of items for loot but it's also possible for a loot attempt to come up with nothing. The higher the luck, the more chances at loot attempts you get (but not the chance of receiving better loot)! Defeating bosses does not reward any experience, gold or class experience, so choose wisely whether you want to try your chance at boss loot or fight regular battles. The first time drop and other boss information can be seen using the '!grumbo boss info <boss_command>' command. </h3>
