    <h2><u>Battles</u>:</h2>
    <h3>You can battle any Grumbo whose level is up to 20 levels higher than you. The experience, gold and chance of victory are based on the level difference between your current level and the Grumbo level. Chance of victory is further swayed based on character and Grumbo stats.<br></br> As the level of the Grumbo increases, grumbo stats and experience increases, but gold and chance of victory decrease. Experience is also decreased independently based on how high your level is. The min victory chance is 5% and the max is 95%. While you get more gold the lower the level of the Grumbo, you will only get 10 gold if you fight a Grumbo who is over 20 levels lower than you.<br> </br> Actives take effect in battle but watch out, different kinds of Grumbos can appear with their own kind of active effects! You will take damage (lose HP) after every battle. If you win, you will lose 3 HP (before factoring in actives). If you lose, you will lose HP proporionate to the difference between the enemy POW and your DEF.
<br></br>Battle attempts recover 1 stock every hour (reduced by SPD) to a maximum of 5.</h3>

    <h2><u>Challenges</u>:</h2>
    <h3>Challenge users to a wager.<br></br>Exp challenge: The loser will always lose the wager they bet, but the winner will win a wager based on the chance of victory which is influenced by level difference. The lower the chance, the higher the wager multiplier.<br></br> </h3>
    <h3>Gold challenge: The chance of winning is always a 50/50. You always win/lose exactly what was wagered.<br></br>Challenge attempts recover 1 stock every hour (reduced by SPD) up to a maximum of 3.</h3>

    <h2><u>Items</u>:</h2>
    <h3>Items have different kinds of effects when used, from doing an immediate action like replenishing a battle stock or making you slightly stronger in your next battle.<br></br>Use the item commands to use and check the details of all your items. Every item has a carry limit, meaning you can only carry a certain amount of that item before you can't carry anymore. </h3>
    <h3>This limit can even be 1. Some items are not consumed even after use.</h3>

    <h2><u>Active Effects</u>:</h2>
    <h3>Currently, active effects are effects that take place during battle. They might increase the chance of victory or decrease it. Active effects can be helpful or troublesome. <br></br>Active effects can have a duration or remain indefinitely. An active effect has a max turn limit of 10 turns. Grumbos can also have active effects that change the outcome of the battle.</h3>
